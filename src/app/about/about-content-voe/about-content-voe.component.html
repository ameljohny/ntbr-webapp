            <p>Alappuzha district forms part of the history of erstwhile state of Travancore.
                Considering the geographical position and physical features of the district, it
                may be assumed that the word &#39;Alappuzha&#39; means the land between the sea
                and a network of rivers flowing into it. The master mind that worked in turning
                Alappuzha to a commercial centre was Raja Kesava Das, the illustrious Divan
                of Travancore.

                <br> This trophy later came to be known as Nehru Trophy, which is celebrated every year by the people of Alappuzha,
                in fond memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
